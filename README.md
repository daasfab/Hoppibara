## 📖 The Story...

Baby Capibara was playing with his friends one day, but suddenly he decided to run to his bedroom to get some toys. WAIT, what is that? Oh no, our Capy is facing numerous obstacles and *you* have to help him reach his bedroom to get his toys.

## 👾 Features

- **Immersive Audio:** Custom audio linked to different actions, as well as the background music will enhance your player experience. 
  
- **Unique Game-Play Elements:** The obstacles and the Capibara will follow the same theme, having the same art style and logical additions (e.g., other capybaras as obstacles).

_(more features will be added as I develop this game further!)_
